## Overview

Idea: **_Code Editor with Electron and TypeScript_**

This is a modern **code editor** built using **Electron** and **TypeScript**. Inspired by tools like **VSCode**, it aims to deliver core editor functionalities while being an educational journey into desktop app development. TypeScript ensures type safety and scalability, while Electron provides a powerful framework for cross-platform desktop applications.

## Challenges

- Balancing simplicity and functionality in core features.
- Implementing advanced capabilities efficiently.
- Scaling the app for larger projects without performance loss.

---

## Why Build This?

- Learn **Electron** and **TypeScript** in-depth.
- Understand the challenges behind modern code editors.
- Build a functional, real-world application.
- Explore advanced topics like **real-time collaboration** and **AI (LLM) integration**.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js (v18.8.0 or higher, up to 22.14.0)** and **npm/yarn**

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/onisimm/licenta-ide
   ```

## Contribution Practices

### Issues

- Every task must have an associated issue.
- Workflow: **Issue → Branch (named after the issue) → Pull Request (PR) → Main branch.**
- Always work on tasks tied to an issue and its corresponding branch.

### Commits

- Use [git cz](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-cz) to ensure consistent and readable commit messages.
- Start commit messages with the issue ID. For example:
  - `#632 add search bar functionality`
  - `#632 fix search bar invisible text`
  - `#632 add search bar unit tests (UTs)`

### Formatting Code

Refer to the [DEVENV.MD](./DEVENV.MD#formatting-code-section) **Prettier** section for detailed instructions on setting up the prettier formatter on save.

This is needed to ensure consistent format throughout the project.
